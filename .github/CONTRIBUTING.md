# Contributing to our repos

At Primer, we believe that endorsing and maintaining open source software is an
important step towards building strong bonds with the wider engineering
community. We appreciate and actively invite contribution from outside of our
organisation.

## Our Standards

We have expectations of our own behaviour and the behaviour of others when
interacting with us in our open source repos.

- Use welcoming and inclusive language at all times
- Be empathetic towards others at all times
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the existing members of the community

There are some behaviours and forms of language that we won't tolerate when
communicating with us about our software. Again, this applies to both our
organisation members and those community members external to it. These include:

- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting and/or derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
- Public or private harassment of individuals or groups
- Publishing others' private information (a.k.a "doxxing"), such as a physical
  or electronic address, without explicit permission from the owner
- Any other conduct that is antithetical to reasonable and polite discourse

## Our Commitments

We appreciate contributions of all forms, but we are not obliged to accept them
such that we will make changes to our software or repos to accommodate them.

We will always make best efforts to discuss contributions, but are not obliged
to provide timelines, contact details, or other information concerning
commitments that we may or may not make to the contribution in question.

## Reporting issues

A bug 🐛 is something nobody ever wants to receive. But, they happen 🤷‍♂️.

Please read the following guidelines before you [report an issue](../issues):

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been
   reported. If it has been, please comment on the existing issue. If it is
   closed, please reference the closed issue in your new issue report.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — the latest `main` branch may already
   contain a fix.

3. **Isolate the problem** — make sure that the code in the project's
   repository is responsible for the issue. Create a broken-down list of steps
   or an extremely simple and immediately viewable example of the issue.

4. **Include a live example** — provide a link, screenshot, video or anything
   that could help us understand better the domain.

Other advice for reporting an issue:

- Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
- Please include: what steps will reproduce the issue, which browsers, devices
  and/or OS you have recreated the issue with.
- Please state what would you expect the outcome to be.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests — patches, improvements, new features — are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

> [!WARNING]
> If your contribution involves a significant amount of work or substantial
> changes to any part of the project, **please open an issue to discuss it first**.
